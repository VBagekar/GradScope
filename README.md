# GradScope
**GradScope** is a machine learning project that predicts a student's chances of getting admitted to graduate school based on academic metrics like GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, SOP, LOR, and Research experience. Built using Linear Regression, this project combines simplicity with precision to offer real-time admission probability predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used comes from Kaggle:  
**[Graduate Admission Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukeshmanral/graduates-admission-prediction)**  
It contains:
- GRE and TOEFL scores  
- University rating  
- Statement of Purpose (SOP) & Letter of Recommendation (LOR) scores  
- CGPA  
- Research experience  
- Chance of Admit (target)

---

## Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset using Pandas  
- Trained a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn  
- Evaluated model accuracy with `R¬≤ Score` and `Mean Squared Error`  
- Predicts chances of admission for custom student input  
- Well-commented and beginner-friendly code  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab (for notebook runtime)  

---

## Model Performance

- R¬≤ Score: 0.83 
- Mean Squared Error: 0.01
  
---

## Future Improvements

- Build a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit or Flask
- Test different regression models (Ridge, Lasso, SVR)
- Add more features like intended major, undergrad university, etc.
